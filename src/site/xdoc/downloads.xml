    <subsection name="Download"></subsection>
    <p>Use the links below to download Apache Hama releases from one of our mirrors. 
    You should verify the integrity of the files using the signatures and checksums available from this page.
    <br/><br/>
    Apache Hama releases are available under the 
    <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License, Version 2.0</a>.
    See the NOTICE.txt file contained in each release artifact for applicable copyright attribution notices.

    <subsection name="PGP Signatures"></subsection>
    <p>All of the release distribution package have been digitally signed (using PGP or GPG) by 
    the Apache Group members that constructed them. There will be an accompanying distribution.asc file 
    in the same directory as the distribution.
    The PGP keys can be found in the MIT key repository (hkp://pgp.mit.edu), 
    the OpenPGP Public Key repository (hkp://subkeys.pgp.net), and within this project's KEYS file, 
    which is located within each download directory.
    <br/><br/>
    Always use the signature files to verify the authenticity of the distribution, e.g.,
    <pre class="green">  % pgpk -a KEYS
  % pgpv hama-x.x.x.tar.gz.asc</pre>
    or,
    <pre class="green">  % gpg --import KEYS
  % gpg --verify hama-x.x.x.tar.gz.asc</pre>
    We offer MD5 hashes as an alternative to validate the integrity of the downloaded files.
    A unix program called md5 or md5sum is included in many unix distributions.
    It is also available as part of <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils">GNU Core Utilities package</a>.
