    <p>Hama Examples package allows you to quickly run examples on your Hama Cluster.<br/>
    This document describes how to quickly run examples, assume that you have already installed Hama cluster and you have tested it.</p>

    <subsection name="Run PageRank on your Hama Cluster"></subsection>
    <p>1. First, you need to generate a symmetric adjacency matrix using the 'gen' command:</p>
    
    <pre>
    % $HAMA_HOME/bin/hama jar hama-examples-x.x.x.jar gen symmetric 100 10 randomgraph 2</pre>

    <p>This will create a graph with 100 nodes and 1K edges and store 2 partitions on HDFS as the sequence file. 
    You can adjust partition and tasks numbers to fit your cluster. Then, run PageRank using:</p>
  <pre>
  % $HAMA_HOME/bin/hama jar hama-examples-x.x.x.jar pagerank randomgraph pagerankresult 4</pre>
    </body>
