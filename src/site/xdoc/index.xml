      <p>
      <strong>Apache Hama</strong> is a pure BSP(Bulk Synchronous Parallel) computing framework on top of HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) for massive scientific computations 
      such as matrix, graph and network algorithms. Currently, it has the following features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Job submission and management interface.</li>
        <li>Multiple tasks per node.</li>
        <li>Input/Output Formatter.</li>
        <li>Checkpoint recovery.</li>
        <li>Support to run in the Cloud using <a href="hama_on_clouds.html">Apache Whirr</a>.</li>
        <li>Support to run with Hadoop YARN.</li>
        <li>Support Pregel-style Graph computing framework as a sub-module.</li>
      </ul>

    <subsection name="Why Hama and BSP?"></subsection>
    <p>Today, many practical data processing applications require a more flexible programming abstraction model that is compatible to run on highly scalable and massive data systems (e.g., HDFS, HBase, etc). A message passing paradigm beyond Map-Reduce framework would increase its flexibility in its communication capability. Bulk Synchronous Parallel (BSP) model fills the bill appropriately. Some of its significant advantages over MapReduce and MPI are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Supports message passing paradigm style of application development</li>
      <li>Provides a flexible, simple, and easy-to-use small APIs</li>
      <li>Enables to perform better than MPI for communication-intensive applications</li>
      <li>Guarantees impossibility of deadlocks or collisions in the communication mechanisms</li>
    </ul>
    
    <subsection name="Getting Started"></subsection>
      <p>
      Start by installing Hama on a Hadoop cluster.

      <p>
      Hama is an open source volunteer project under the Apache Software Foundation. We encourage you to learn about the project and contribute your expertise. 
      Here are some starter links: <br/>

    <subsection name="Disclaimer"></subsection>
      <p>
       Apache Hama is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache Software Foundation (ASF), 
      sponsored by the Apache Incubator. Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the infrastructure, 
      communications, and decision making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. 
      While incubation status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, 
      it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.
